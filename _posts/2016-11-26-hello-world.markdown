Hello, World! Look's like you've found my blog! I've always had a lot to say and never had the time to write it all down, but I'm hoping and looking forward to changing that.

I don't want to force my blog series to be focused on one thing or another, and will instead let it grow and evolve organically with time. I do, however, hope to utilize this space to express my opinions, thoughts and feelings about a variety of topics, share my ideas, and help those looking for a wee bit of guidance in this massive world of tech.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on any topics discussed here, as I'd much rather this be a place of open conversation and dialog. I'm always open to feedback, too. So if you've got ideas on what I should write about, or what I should be doing differently, please don't hesitate to share.

**H.**
