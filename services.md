If you're looking for a hard working, motivated individual interested in helping your business grow, look no further!

## Web Design + Development
Having a web presence in the world today is practically a necessity. Many will base their opinions about your company on your website and online presence. I've helped many new companies and start ups design and build their websites and online presence, while further refining and perfecting websites for established companies and large businesses.

I'm also capable of building web applications (websites that have functionality - think user accounts, payment processing etc) and have also built a few of my own. I'm always <a href="mailto:harismahmood89@gmail.com">interested in hearing</a> your ideas and to discover how I might be able to help.

## Consulting + Strategy
Although basic feedback and strategy development is something I help with through my design and development services, I do also like to focus and hone in on just the product or company strategy. I've had the opportunity to work on and develop strategies for various projects, big and small. I would love to hear more about your business ideas + strategies and how I can help guide and further develop them with you, so please <a href="mailto:harismahmood89@gmail.com">get in touch</a>!

## Brand Design
Do you have an incredible new idea for a company and want a bold look to attract customers? Do you already have an established business that needs a bit of lovin' and polish?

I've been helping companies, big and small, improve their brand and presence on and offline for many years. <a href="mailto:harismahmood89@gmail.com">Get in touch</a> to see how I can help you too!
